# The C Book

I have always enjoyed Markdown and I believe Markdown should be the most efficient and productive styleguide for anybody writing stuff on computer programming languages and similar technical concepts.

- Mike Banahan
- Declan Brady
- Mark Doran

And I use [GitBooks](http://gitbook.com).

With my level of computer skills and literacy, I could not find a better way to be a part of the most peaceful ***Open source world***.
